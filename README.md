## Introduction
According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China's annual report, we collect population data of various provinces over years. We implement a series of visualization tools to convert the distribution of population associated with social development features into easily understood images. We hope our visualization will give a clear thought of the reasons and the patterns behind some social phenomena to researchers who are interested.
